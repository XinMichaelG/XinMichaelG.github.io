  <H1><strong> impression of view </strong></H1>
   <p>        Compare to first one the second part is more like a puzzle game, following the clues step by step to solve the mystery of the chamber of secrets. However, the screenwriter in the film has no small flaws in the layout, nearly three hours of the length is baffling, It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices.</p>
    
    <H1><strong> Intro scenario  </strong></H1>
    <P>        The second instalment of boy wizard Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, based on the novel by JK Rowling. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during his second year at Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees that fight back, flying cars, spiders that talk and deadly warnings written in blood on the walls of the school.             </P>
